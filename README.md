practical exam automation web app


This is a decent web app developed to automate practical exmas for a univesity(UTU was kept in focus for this one but it can extrapolated 
to any other university too!) in which their are certain number of colleges under the same university and all the colleges would
offer other college's faculties to come and visit their college as an external examiner and for that it contains a portal in which
each faculty can sign up/sign in and choose their favourite subjects and then can view which nearest college is alloted to them.

The automation is done buy admin where he is provided with other various privileges too.

This portal uses an emailing feature which implemented using the PHP Mailer which you can refer from https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer
For PHP Mailer you would need Composer which is a PHP dependency manager.
